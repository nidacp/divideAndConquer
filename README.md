# divideAndConquer

Solves several divide and conquer problems, including:

SQUARES
For a given n x n square called grid, outputs/prints the number of white areas and their sizes.
Example input:
w b b w w b w w
b b b b w b w w
w w w b b w w w
w b w b w w b b
w b w w w b w b
w b b b b w w w
w b w b b w w w
w b w b b w w w
Example output:
1, 3, 21, 10, 2

INVERSIONS
Counts the number of inversions (a pair (i,j) of an array indices with i < j and A[i] > A[j]) in a given array arr and prints out the answer.
Example input:
[1,3,5,2,4,6]
Example output:
In  [1, 3, 5, 2, 4, 6] , there are 3  inversions.

POINTS
Determines which two points in a graph are closest together.
Example input:
[(-2,2),(-2,0),(0,0),(1,1),(3,3),(4,0),(5,2)] 
Example output:
[[0, 0], [1, 1]] are the two closest points.
