# divideAndConquer

Solves several divide and conquer problems, including:<br />

SQUARES<br />
For a given n x n square called grid, outputs/prints the number of white areas and their sizes.<br />
Example input:<br />
w b b w w b w w<br />
b b b b w b w w<br />
w w w b b w w w<br />
w b w b w w b b<br />
w b w w w b w b<br />
w b b b b w w w<br />
w b w b b w w w<br />
w b w b b w w w<br />
Example output:<br />
1, 3, 21, 10, 2<br />

INVERSIONS<br />
Counts the number of inversions (a pair (i,j) of an array indices with i < j and A[i] > A[j]) in a given array arr and prints out the answer.<br />
Example input:<br />
[1,3,5,2,4,6]<br />
Example output:<br />
In  [1, 3, 5, 2, 4, 6] , there are 3  inversions.<br />

POINTS<br />
Determines which two points in a graph are closest together.<br />
Example input:<br />
[(-2,2),(-2,0),(0,0),(1,1),(3,3),(4,0),(5,2)] <br />
Example output:<br />
[[0, 0], [1, 1]] are the two closest points.<br />
